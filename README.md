# Stockmarket-ML-Emulator

This is a working directory of my predictions and analysis of the current economic trend through the evaluation of stock market prices.
To run the predictions and get the data visualization on your laptop, install Jupyter Lab and import the .ipynb files into an IDE.
Install all dependencies with pip and run each cell accordingly.
